# Hello_World
A collection of my resume, cover letter, letters of recommendation, official transcripts, and a little more.

My name is Bianca Orozco and I graduated from California State Univeristy, Monterey Bay in 2016 with a Bachelor of Science focused in Mathematics. During my years in undergrad, I took introductory statistics courses and in doing so, learned the models and methods used in a career in technology, engineering, and sciences. I gained a knowledge in statistical inferences through parameter estimation and regression modeling using R and RStudio. 

As I progressed and grew to enjoy the challange, I continued to take more advanced statistics courses that covered theory application with a focus on nonparametric statistical methods for hypothesis tests, empirical distribution estimation, bootstrap, estimation theory, chi-square tests, one-way ANOVA, and simple linear regression. 

Unfortunately, without a minor in statistics to show for my knowledge and accomplishments, I will be sharing my analyses here. I will also be showcasing my Mathematics Senior Capstone Project which was heavily focused on statistical analysis using multiple logistic regression.
